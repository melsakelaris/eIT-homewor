*WWDC 2022*

The topics I found most interesting from the WWDC involved updates to the Apple Watch. These updates are mainly health related. I have a personal interest in developing technologies that improve the overall wellbeing of society. That being said, I found the Afib tracking feature to be very exciting, as I know many people suffer from this condition and could use the watch's information to stay in tune with their heart health. 

I also found the medication reminders and drug interactions features to be particularly useful. As someone who takes daily medications, I could definitely benefit from the reminder feature. I also find the drug interactions feature exciting, because this is something I have thought would be a useful application for a long time.

On another note, I considered the downsides of some of the new features. For instance, Apple's Smart Home feature is said to let users control and monitor events in their home from their phone. I saw this as a potential privacy risk, in the case that someone was hacked or lost their phone.

Additionally, I thought the new featurres included in CarPlay, such as displaying apps on a user's car's console, could be a distraction and pose a potential safety risk.
